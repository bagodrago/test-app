This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Website Test App
This app is a sandbox for me to use to learn and practice NextJS.
This is in service of the website I will eventually be making for myself.

### Here are some of the features you can expect to see:

- Functional, dynamic navbar that adjusts properly to fit any screen
- Cool effects that add extra polish to the site without being an eyesore
- Smooth scrolling with buttons that lead to new areas of the page
- A project library with pop-ups for the work I have done on my GitHub
- And much, much more...!
